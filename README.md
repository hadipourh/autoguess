Autoguess integrates a wide range of CP/SMT/SAT/MILP solvers, as well as the Groebner basis algorithm to automatically solve the guess-and-determine (GD) problem.

---

## Overall Structure

The following shape represents the overall structure of Autoguess. As it can be seen, Autoguess relies on [Minizinc](https://www.minizinc.org/), [PySAT](https://github.com/pysathq/pysat), [pySMT](https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt), [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) and [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). Providing a Python interface, Autoguess translates the guess-and-determine problem to a SAT, SMT, MILP or Groebner basis computation problem and then call an appropriate solver to solve it. It also utilizes [Grazphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/) to visualize the discovered determination flow.

## Installation

Autoguess has been developed in [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) which is one of the most used [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) distributions. However, thanks to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) it can simply be used in other platforms including macOS and Windows. We suggest the following methods to install and use Autoguess.

### Method 1

The easiest way is using the provided [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) to get Autoguess and all of its dependencies at once. To do so, regardless of what OS you use, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) at first. Next, download our [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile), navigate into the directory where you have stored it and build a local image of Autoguess via the following single line command:

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile -t autoguess .
```

Next, you will be able to run Autoguess via the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it autoguess
```

The constructed image is self-contained including MiniZinc, PySAT, pySMT, SageMath. Although Autoguess includes a direct Python interface to [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) as well, Gurobi is not included in the above image. Hence, Gurobi and its license should be installed separately if you are willing to use the MILP-based method to solve the guess-and-determine problem.

### Method 2

If you have already installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and you are not enough patient to build a local image of Autoguess, you can simply download a prebuilt image of Autoguess hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) via the following command:

```sh
docker pull hoseinhadipour/autoguess
```

Then, you can run Autoguess by the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it hoseinhadipour/autoguess
```

### Method 3

## Format of Input File

The input file can be a plain text separated into the following parts:

- Algebraic relations. This section begins with `algebraic relations` and includes the algebraic relations (currently the algebraic relations over GF(2) are merely supported).
- Connection relations. This section begins with `connection relations` and includes the connections relations consisting of symmetric or implication relations.
- Known variables. This section begins with `known` key word under which all known variables are specified.
- Target variables. This section begins with `target` key word under which all target variables are specified.
- The input file must be ended with a line including the `end` key word.
- The lines starting with `#` character are interpreted as comments.

The following example, represents the overall structure of an input file.

```text
# Sample input file
algebraic relations
X1*X4 + X2*X5 + X1 + X3 + X4
X2*X3 + X1*X6 + X3*X4 + X1 
X1*X4 + X1*X5 + X3 + X4 + X6
X5*X6 + X4*X3 + X2
connection relations
X3, X5, X2
X1, X2, X4, X6 => X5
known
X2
target
X1
X3
X4
X5
X6
end
```

You can find many other input files inside the [ciphers](ciphers) folder. Moreover, Autoguess supports system of relations including variables with different weights when the SAT or MILP solvers are used. [Example5](#example-5) and [ZUC](#gd-attack-on-zuc) are two example where the system of relations includes variables with different weights.

### Example 3

In this example, we show the application of Autoguess to discover the possible early abortion techniques. The input file of this example is located in [Example3](./ciphers/Example3/relationfile.txt) which includes the following contents:

```text
# Example to describe the early abortion technique
# (x0 <<< 3) + S(x1) + x2 = 0
# S(x0) + S(x2) + (x5 <<< 2) = 0
# L(x1 + x2) + x5 = 0
# x2 + L(x3) = 0
# S(x3 * S(x1 * x4)) + L(x0) + x6 = 0
# (S(x4) xor L(x6)) + x3 = 0
connection relations
x0, x1, x2
x0, x2, x5
x1, x2, x5
x2, x3
x3, x1, x4 => t

end
```

We emphasize that the lines starting with `#` are considered as comments.

The full content of the output file generated by Autoguess is as follows which includes many useful information guiding the user to find possible early abortion techniques:

############################################################
The following 3 variable(s) are guessed:

############################################################
The following 0 variable(s) are initially known:

############################################################
Target variables:
x0, x1, x2, x5, x3, x4, t, x6
############################################################
Determination flow:

State 0:
x1, x5 in symmetric relation [x1, x2, x5] are known: x1, x5 ===> x2
############################################################
State 1:
x1, x2 in symmetric relation [x0, x1, x2] are known: x1, x2 ===> x0
x2, x5 in symmetric relation [x0, x2, x5] are known: x2, x5 ===> x0
x2 in symmetric relation [x2, x3] are known: x2 ===> x3
############################################################
State 2:
t, x0 in symmetric relation [t, x0, x6] are known: t, x0 ===> x6
############################################################
State 3:
x6, x3 in symmetric relation [x4, x6, x3] are known: x6, x3 ===> x4
############################################################
The following variables are known in final state:
x0, x1, x2, x5, x3, x4, t, x6
############################################################
The following relations have not been used in determination (they might be used to check the correctness of guesses):
x3, x1, x4 => t
############################################################
The following variables can be deduced from multiple paths:

x0 can be deduced from:
x0, x1, x2
x0, x2, x5
```

The first lines give a brief description of the input. The main body, describes how the remaining variables can be deduced from the guessed variables. As you can see, three steps (state copies) are sufficient to determine all of the variables. According to the last two lines of the output files, `x0` can be deduced from two different equations, i.e., `(x0 <<< 3) + S(x1) + x2 = 0` and `S(x0) + S(x2) + (x5 <<< 2) = 0`. By the way, according to the determination flow, `x0` is determined before guessing `t`. Hence, a portion of wrong values for the two guessed variables, namely, `x1, x5` can be detected and excluded from the search space before guessing `x0` which results in a GD attack with less time complexity by a factor of `2^|x0|`.

### Example 4

In this example, we aim to show the advantage of preprocessing phase when some algebraic relations are included in the input file. The input file of this example which is located in [Example4](./ciphers/Example4/algebraic_relations.txt) includes the following quadratic equations over `GF(2)`:

```text
algebraic relations
X1*X3 + X2*X4 + X1 + X3 + X4
X2*X3 + X1*X4 + X3*X4 + X1 + X2 + X4
X2*X4 + X3*X4 + X1 + X3 + 1
X1*X2 + X1*X3 + X2*X3 + X3 + X4 + 1
X1*X2 + X2*X3 + X1*X4 + X3
X1*X3 + X1*X4 + X3*X4 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4
X1*X2 + X2*X4 + X1 + 1
end
```

***CP***

The preprocessor of Autoguess is enabled by default and to disable it you can use `--preprocess 0` in front of your command when you call Autoguess. To adjust the degree of preprocessing phase you can use  this switch `--D <your favorite degree, e.g., 2>`. For example in the following command, we apply the preprocessing phase of Autoguess with degree of 2.

```sh
python3 autoguess.py --inputfile ciphers/Example4/algebraic_relations.txt --solver cp --maxsteps 10 --preprocess 1 --D 2 --dglayout circo
```

### Example 6

In this example, we try to analyze a toy stream cipher which its keystream generation phase works based on the following state machine:

```text
for i = 0 ... N:
     x_0_i+1 <--- f0(x_6_i, x_7_i <<< 16)
     x_1_i+1 <--- f1(x_7_i, x_0_i <<< 8)
     x_2_i+1 <--- f2(x_0_i, x_1_i <<< 16)
     x_3_i+1 <--- f3(x_1_i, x_2_i <<< 8)
     x_4_i+1 <--- f4(x_2_i, x_3_i <<< 16)
     x_5_i+1 <--- f5(x_3_i, x_4_i <<< 8)
     x_6_i+1 <--- f6(x_4_i, x_5_i <<< 16)
     x_7_i+1 <--- f7(x_5_i, x_6_i <<< 8)
     z_i+1 <--- g(x_7_i, x_2_i)
```

where `f0, ..., f7`, and `g` are some functions. The following shape represnts how the state machine of this toy stream cipher works.

![rabbit_0](ciphers/Example6//Shapes/rabbit_0.svg)

Assuming that the output words, i.e., `z_i` for `i = 1, 2, ...` are known, we aim to find the minimum number of guessed variables to retrieve the initial state, namely, `x_0_0, x_1_0, ..., x_7_0`.

### GD Attack on 1 Round of AES with 1 Known Plaintext/Ciphertext Pair

![aes_1_round_gd_dg](ciphers/AES/Shapes/GD-1Round/aes_1_round_gd_dg.svg)

***SAT***

```sh
python3 autoguess.py --inputfile ciphers/AES/relationfile_aes1kp_1r_mg6_ms14.txt --solver sat --maxguess 6 --maxsteps 14
```

Terminal outputs:

```text
Generating the SAT model ...
SAT model was generated after 0.32 seconds

Solving with cadical153 ...
Time used by SAT solver: 0.02 seconds
Number of guesses: 6
Number of known variables in the final state: 96 out of 96
The following 6 variable(s) are guessed:
X_0_0_0, X_0_1_1, W_0_0_0, W_0_2_2, W_0_3_0, K_1_3_2
```

As you can see Autoguess finds a GD attack on 1 round of AES in less than a second. Autoguess uses [CaDiCaL](http://fmv.jku.at/cadical153/) as the SAT solver by default. However, user can simply choose another SAT solver among `cadical153,glucose3,glucose4,lingeling,maplechrono,maplecm,maplesat,minicard,minisat22,minisat-gh` by this switch : `--satsolver SAT_SOLVER_NAME`.

If we use the Groebner basis, Autoguess generates multiple minimal guess bases at once and stores them inside the [temp](temp) folder. For example, in the above example, in addition to `[K_1_3_3, K_1_3_2, K_1_3_1, K_1_3_0, K_1_2_0, K_1_1_0]` Autoguess discovered many other minimal guess bases some of which are represented below:

### GD Attack on Enocoro128-v2

![alternative_repre_enocoro](ciphers/Enocoro128v2/Shapes/alternative_repre_enocoro.png)

***SAT***

In this example we use [MiniSat](https://github.com/niklasso/minisat) to find a guess-and-determine attack on Enocoro128-v2.

```sh
python3 autoguess.py --inputfile ciphers/Enocoro128v2/relationfile_enocoro_16clk_mg18_ms22.txt --solver sat --satsolver minisat22 --maxguess 18 --maxsteps 22
```

Terminal output:

```text

Number of guesses: 18
Number of known variables in the final state: 113 out of 113
The following 18 variable(s) are guessed:
b_0, b_4, c_6, d_2, e_16, e_4, e_5, a_3, e_7, e_20, e_8, a_6, b_10, e_11, a_10, a_12, d_22, a_14
```

As you can see, thansk to the SAT-based method implemented in Autoguess the current best guess-and-determine atack on Enocoro128-v2 can be found in less than a second, whereas finding this atack via the other methods such as MILP-based or Groebner basis approaches takes much longer. Autoguess also generates the following shape representing the determination flow in the discovered GD attack.

### GD Attack on ZUC

![zuc_structure](ciphers/ZUC/Shapes/zuc.svg)

***SAT***

In this example, instead of finding an optimum guess basis which could be very time consuiming, we only check to see whether a guess basis smaller than the best previous one exists.

```sh
python3 autoguess.py --inputfile ciphers/ZUC/relationfile_zuc_9clk_mg0_ms35.txt --solver sat --maxguess 0 --maxsteps 35
```

Terminal output:

```text
Generating the SAT model ...
SAT model was generated after 0.45 seconds

Solving with cadical153 ...
Time used by SAT solver: 0.00 seconds
Number of guesses: 0
Number of known variables in the final state: 273 out of 273
The following 0 variable(s) are guessed:
```

As you can see, checking whether the given subset of variables can be a guess basis takes less than a second. The following shape which is automatically genearted by Autoguess, illustrates the determination flow in the produced guess-and-determine attack.

### GD Attack on Bivium-A

The following pseudocode represnts the keystream generation pahse of Bivium (Bivium-B):

```python
for i = 1 to N do
    t1 <--- s_66 + s_93
    t2 <--- s_162 + s_177
    z_i <--- t1 + t2
    t1 <--- t1 + s_91 * s_92 + s_171
    t2 <--- t2 + s_175 * s_176 + s_69
    (s_1, s_2, ..., s_177) <--- (t_2, s_1, ..., s_92)
    (s_94, s_95, ..., s_177) <--- (t_1, s_94, ..., s_176)
end for
```

Bivium-A differs from Bivium (Bivium-B) in the linear output filter such that `z_i <--- t_1`.

***SAT***

It should be noted our attack on Bivium-A was performed on a different computer with the folowing setting:

```text
OS: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz
RAM: 16 GB
```

```sh
python3 autoguess.py --inputfile ciphers/Bivium/BiviumA/relationfile_biviuma_177clk_mg32_ms65.txt --preprocess 0 --maxguess 24 --maxsteps 85 --solver sat
```

Terminal output:

```text
Generating the SAT model ...
SAT model was generated after 3.28 seconds

Solving via a SAT solver ...
Time used by SAT solver: 53414.46 seconds
Number of guesses: 24
Number of known variables in the final state: 1062 out of 1062
The following 24 variable(s) are guessed:
b_21, a_31, am_41, am_42, b_68, a_71, a_73, a_97, a_100, a_102, am_100, b_105, b_107, b_110, a_111, a_126, a_127, a_128, a_141, b_172, a_172, a_173, b_181, a_198
```

As you can see, the whole internal state of Bivium-A (177 bits) can be uniquely determined with guessing only 24 bits! The following graph illustrates how the internal state can be determined from the guessed variables.

Interestingly, we obserevd that using the preprocessing phase in this case we can significantly improve the performance of the tool when we use the constraint programming based approaches. By the way, we obserevd that, the Groebner basis approach outperforms the other methods in this case.

### Key Bridging in Impossible Differential Attack on LBlock

In this applciation, we apply Autoguess to find a minimal guess basis for the key bits invloved in the impossible differential attack on 23 rounds of LBlock presented in [Automatic Search for Key-Bridging Technique: Applications to LBlock and TWINE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/414.pdf). Acording to our observations, Groebner basis approach performs faster in this example.
